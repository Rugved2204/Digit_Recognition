# Digit_Recognition

This is a simple digit recognition task solved using neural networks. The neural networks have been implemented from scratch using only basic maths and numpy. It is 2 layered neural network which consists of 784 neurons in the input layer, 10 neurons each in the hidden and the output layer.

The model is getting an accuracy of 75% on training set and approximately 72% on test set.

This accuracy can be incresed by adding more layers and complecity to the model.
